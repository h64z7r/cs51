Homework Assignment 2: Mortality Rates
Fall 2024PLEASE ROUND ALL DECIMAL RATES (NOT PERCENTS) TO 6 DECIMAL PLACES
1. Direct Age Adjustment
a. Use Tables 1  2 to calculate New York 2020 direct age adjusted mortality rate. Use the overall US Population age distribution for 2020 as the Standard Population (Table 2). For age-specific deaths rates, fill in all columns in Tables 1  2, rounding age specific mortality rates to 6 decimal points (25 points)Table 1: All-Cause Mortality by Age Group in New York, 2020AgeCategoryNY Population, 2020DeathsAge-specific Mortality Rate (to 6 decimal places)0-245,710,2392,6580.00046525-445,268,7618,9550.00170045-644,988,20735,6810.00715365+3,369,569156,0880.046323TOTAL19,336,776203,382Table 2: Direct Age Adjustment of New York Mortality Rate to US Standard PopulationAge Category2020 US Population(A)2020 NY Mortality Age-Specific Rate(B)(A) X (B) = (C)(round to 2 decimal places)0-24104,360,7630.00046548527.7525-4487,018,8030.001700147931.9745-6484,277,2140.007153602834.9165+55,792,5010.0463232584476.02TOTAL331,449,2810.0556413383770.65
b. The age adjusted mortality rate (per 100,000) for New York in 2020 was: (15 points)
48527.75 + 147931.97 + 602834.91 + 2584476.02 = 3383770.65
3383770.65 / 331449281 * 100000 = 1020.901 per 100000
c. Calculate crude mortality rate (per 100,000) in New York in 2020 (5 points)
203382 / 19336776 * 100000 = 1051.789 per 100000
d. Explain the difference between the crude and age adjusted mortality rates for New York in 2020. (15 points)
The crude mortality rate does not account for age distribution, but the age-adjusted mortality rate does. Age-adjusted mortality accounts for the population's age distribution, allowing for comparisons between groups.
The two rates differ because New York's population is more likely to be older than the national average代 写SAR HS 300 Epidemiology Assignment 2 Mortality Rates Fall 2024SQL
代做程序编程语言. The crude rate (1051.789 per 100000) is greater since it represents the actual number of deaths, but the age-adjusted rate (1020.901 per 100000) accounts for age differences and is slightly lower.
a. There were 4,383,729 total deaths in the United States in 2020. The crude mortality rate (per 100,000) for the US in 2020 was: (5 points)
4383719 / 331449281 * 100000 = 1322.591
b. Calculate the Direct Standardized Mortality Ratio (DSMR) for New York in 2020: (5 points)
1051.789 / 1020.901 = 1.030
c. Write a statement to interpret your DSMR result in b) above (5 points)
A DSMR of 1.03 indicates that the crude mortality rate in New York in 2020 is 3% higher than the age-adjusted mortality rate.
3. In 2021, Portland, a community with a population of 1,500,000 experienced 11,840 deaths. 1,538 of these deaths were due to COVID-19.
a. Calculate the crude mortality rate per 100,000 in Portland in 2021 (5 points)
11840 / 1500000 * 100000 = 789.333 per 100000
b. Calculate the cause specific mortality rate per 100,000 from COVID-19 in Portland in 2021 (5 points)  
1538 / 1500000 * 100000 = 102.533 per 100000
c. Calculate the proportional mortality ratio (PMR) from COVID-19 in Portland in 2021 (5 points)
1538 / 11840 *100% = 12.99%
4. You are provided further information on Portland. 60,000 residents were aged 20-29 years of age. Among this age group, there were 233 deaths, of which 79 were due to COVID-19.
a. What was the age specific mortality rate per 100,000 among the 20-29 years age group in Portland? (5 points)
Age specific mortality rate = 233 / 60000 * 100000 = 388.333 per 100000
b. What is the cause specific mortality per 100,000 due to COVID-19 among the 20-29 years age group in Portland? (5 points)
Cause specific mortality rate = 79 / 60000 * 100000 = 131.667 per 100000
